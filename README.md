## Create Sales
Now after completing the profile and adding products to the business, you can start creating business sales for customers as receipts/invoices or for record-keeping purposes. Go to `>Create Receipt`.

When creating sales/receipts, ignore the `Select Status` field because this field will automatically be selected based on;
* The field be  `Paid` if the order total billing is equal to the paying amount.
* The field be  `Installment`  if paying amount is less than the total billing.
* The field be `Unpaid` if and only if the paying amount is 0.

The `customer name` field is required but the `phone number` field is only required when the business owner has made a setting to send sms alert to customers... The same as the `email field`.
The `Billing` details is not always required.

Start typing the product name and it will automatically populate like products from store indicating product whether the product is in `stock` or `out of stock` and `quantity left` for stock. When the product is selected, the `product rate` field will be filled with the selected product `selling price` and the  `product amount` will be calculated based on the `quantity` in question multiply by the `product rate`.
